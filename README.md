# Python Mini Projects
This is a mini-projects repository made using Python.
Each mini-project made has clear comments inside its code. If you find any thing difficult do not hesitate to contact me to clarify it.
Those projects are easy to understand and can help you understand more Python coding.
I will keep updating this repository and might add soon a repository with full projects not mini ones. 

If you find this repository helpful dont forget to star it ! :) Thank you.
